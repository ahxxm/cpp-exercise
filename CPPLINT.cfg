# - legay/copyright: WTFPL does not need this

# - whitespace/blank_line: blank line at the end of the file.. is not redundant
# - whitespace/indent: private/public indent +1... editor does not agree
# - readability/braces: unnecessary braces after for/function.. but not unacceptable
# - build/c++11: unproved c++11 headers.. using C++14 so
# - runtime/references: " Is this a non-const reference? If so, make const or use a pointer", const specifier for const, pointer for non-const... hmm
# - runtime/int: " Use int16/int64/etc, rather than the C type long" <- FIXME:
# - build/include_subdir: "Include the directory when naming .h files",CMakefile includes single .h now
# - whitespace/comment: 2 spaces after code, think 1 is enough and editor settings agree with me
# - readability/todo: TODO(username): content, since this project is not corporating..
# - whitespace/newline: should appear in the same line as else, rb-tree.cpp has complex condition judgement
